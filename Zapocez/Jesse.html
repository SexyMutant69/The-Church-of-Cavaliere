        <h2><br>Where have all the debates stemmed from?</h2>
        <p>Jesse Laico is a person shrouded in mystery. We don't know where, when or how he was born... Our mere human brains wouldn't probably even be able
            to comprehend these fact - That's why it's better they stay an enigma. What we can debate about, however, is Jesse's elite status: The only thing 
            we could be able to empirically prove or at least try to support with evidence. That's why there are countless discussion about the topic of
            Jesse's elite status... On this website, I will try to gather the most convincing points and arguments, while trying to stay as impartial as possible.         
        </p>
    
        <p><br>I've put together a chart tracking Jesse's proggresion over the years. With this you can get the basic picture of Jesse's status.
        However, there are only two official records regarding Jesse and his gains. That's why this table is a bit shorter than we'd hope to be... Enjoy though!</p>

          <h2>The Main Arguments for Jesse being Elite</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>According to all evidence, Jesse and Jeff are the same person and Jeff's elite status simply cannot be ever questioned</li>
            <li>His proggres despite his injury</li>
              <ul>
                <li>Jesse is known to have been quite heavily injured, which heavily limits the speed his proggresion</li>
                <li>In spite of all this, Jesse made pretty impressive gains over the years</li>
              </ul>
            <li>Consistency</li>
              <ul>
                <li>If you look at Jesse over the years, the gains he made are indisputable... and more importantly consistent - Every year, Jesse is stronger and stronger</li>
                <li>Jesse also doesn't seem to be slowing down with his dedication and keeps packing on muscle... That means he is far from his potential and we can only guess how insanely athletic he will become</li>
              </ul>
            <li>His Leannes</li>
              <ul>If you look at Jesse, you will see he is very lean all year round - This means that although he hisn't a mass monster, he has the two most important attributes needed for an epic body: He has a six (or even eight??) pack and is an athleate (of course)</ul> 
              <ul>Also, his eight pack mentioned above was achieved by his legendary Baby Shark Ab Shredder routine, that brought smiles and abs to people all over the world</ul>
          </ol>

        <div>
<p><br><br>Ok so those were the main points I gathered... I may not have stayed as impartial as I promised before because my love for Jesse is 
            immesurable and I can't say a single bad thing about him :)
            <br>If you'd like to see more, feel free to click the links below ti visit my other websitse regarding Jeff and Jesse... Until then, stay athletic and don't forget: "If you wanna look like an athleate, you gotta train like an athlete"
